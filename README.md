# ðŸ¦  Neural Cellular Automata
**Built With PyTorch Lightning**

## ðŸ”¬ Why?

- PyTorch Lightning implementations are clean
- I wanted to learn about these for fun
- I have some ideas I want to try!

## ðŸ§ª Get Started

1. Clone this repository

2. Install the requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the initial example in `python3.9 nca/example_texture_nca.py` which is a port of the
   simple pytorch example for [Self-Organising Textures](https://distill.pub/selforg/2021/textures/)
