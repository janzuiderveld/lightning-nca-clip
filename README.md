# ðŸ¦  Neural Cellular Automata
**Built With PyTorch Lightning**

## ðŸ”¬ Why?

- PyTorch Lightning implementations are clean
- I wanted to learn about these for fun
- I have some ideas I want to try!

## ðŸ§ª Get Started

Run the initial example in `nca/example_texture_nca.py` which is a port of the
simple pytorch example for [Self-Organising Textures](https://distill.pub/selforg/2021/textures/)
